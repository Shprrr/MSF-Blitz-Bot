ID_ME_BO_ORANGEGEAR_MAKEGOOD_202009,"Commander,\n\nOver the weekend, there was an issue with the Orange Catalyst Orb where some players received 3,000 orbs from the Valuable Lessons Calendar. The Dev team resolved the mistake with the orb quickly and is currently working on next steps to make a correction to the players' accounts who may have opened any of those incorrectly granted orbs, and made use of the resources. This correction will not impact players who did not erroneously receive these orbs. As a part of the correction, we will be taking the game down for a period of time later in the week.\n\nWe understand reverting gear progress is extremely frustrating and it's not something we take lightly, but the severity of our mistake is such that we can't let affected players keep their progress, nor can we make the incorrect amounts available to everyone. After the correction goes into effect, we'll be sending out two forms of compensation:\n\n- To the players directly affected by the correction: you'll receive a compensation package for the resources and time invested, as well as the inconvenience we've caused.\n\n- To all other players: a compensation package to alleviate the competitive advantage that other players gained between the time the bug went live and the corrections and the general inconvenience that this issue has caused you as well.\n\nWe apologize for our mistake, and thank you for your patience."

ID_ME_BO_SSOFFERISSUE_ANNOUNCE,"We recently identified an issue that allowed players to purchase a Silver Surfer offer more than the allowed limit.

We will be closely monitoring the number of purchases carefully, and any account found to acquire it more than twice will be at risk of an indefinite ban. Intentionally leveraging exploits is against our Terms of Service, and while we know loopholes like this are our responsibility to oversee, we won't hesitate taking punitive action against players who exploit them while we work to close them.\n\nOur team is currently diagnosing the cause of the issue and is planning a course of action on how to prevent it from happening again in the future.

Purchasing a costume doesn't recruit a new character, or affect stats, Power, or abilities.\n\n<color=#fff568>Bits & Costume Credits</color>\nCostumes can be purchased using either Bits or Costume Credits. You can earn varying amounts of Costume Credits for free over time by playing the game and participating in various upcoming events.\n\nStarting on May 3, 5:00PM (PDT), you can also purchase Costume Credits at any time via the Costume Credits Orb using Power Cores. If you can't wait to acquire your first costume, there will be offers available for the first few days of the feature containing enough Costume Credits to purchase the initial costumes.\n\nSome costumes will be available through Bits. You can earn Bits via limited-time opportunities, such as events, orbs, and offers. Bits will be automatically converted to Costume Credits for future use when an event or opportunity ends. Event pricing and the Costume Credit conversion rate are subject to change.\n\nBe sure to spend your Bits and Costume Credits regularly, as there's a cap to the max number you can keep in your inventory. Bits will only be converted to Costume Credits up to the cap and any excess Bits will be discarded.\n\n<color=#fff568>Where to Find Costumes</color>\nTo unlock a costume, you can either head to the Costumes Tab in the Store or go directly to your Roster. The Costumes Store will display select costumes, but not all of the options. To view all of the characters with costumes, filter your Roster by ""Costumes"" and then go to the newly added Costume Select screen to purchase a costume.\n\nCostumes made available via Costume Credits are permanent additions and can be purchased at any time. Select costumes will be event-exclusive and may not be available for an indefinite period afterward, so keep an eye out for these collector's items.\n\nHead to the Store now to view the latest costumes: Captain Marvel (Vers) and Elektra (Modern)!"
